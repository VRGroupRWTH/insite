/*

 This script demonstrates the usage of the Socket specialization of
 the RecordingBackend interface for NEST.

 A minimal receiving server in Python looks like this:

 import socket
 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
 s.bind(('', 50000)) # '' means all available interfaces
 while True:
     print s.recv(1024)
